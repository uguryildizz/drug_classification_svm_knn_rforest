# Drug Classification using Classification Algorithms

Drug Classification with SVM, KNN and Random Forest Algorithms.

Contains:
- Univariate Variable Analysis
- Data Analysis and Visualization
- Preparing Data and Feature Engineering
- Model Implementation

Conclusion
- Random Forest classifier and SVM classifier (after hyperparameter tuning) have a good scores.
- KNN classifier has worst score in three clasifiers.

### About Dataset

The data set contains various information that effect the predictions like Age, Sex, BP, Cholesterol levels, Na to Potassium Ratio and finally the drug type.
